❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning 🩺💻


This project leverages machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease 🫀 based on key medical attributes. Using advanced models and data visualization 📊, it uncovers patterns and helps make data-driven predictions for healthcare support.



✨ Key Features:
🔍 Dataset: Medical attributes like age, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more, sourced from Kaggle and UCI.



🧠 Models Used:

📈 Logistic Regression
🤖 Naive Bayes!
🛠️ Support Vector Machines (SVM)
👣 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
🌳 Decision Trees
🌲 Random Forests


Data set from kaggle :

📊 Evaluation: Models are compared using accuracy scores and confusion matrices to identify the best performer.

⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized parameters (e.g., random_state) for better accuracy.

🎨 Visualizations: Data distributions and correlations analyzed with matplotlib and seaborn for insights.

🎯 Objective:
To develop an accurate and interpretable model for predicting heart disease 🫀, enabling early diagnosis and aiding decision-making in healthcare 🏥.
